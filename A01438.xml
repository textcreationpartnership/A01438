            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>ET not to pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and stand not in feare to be refour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto death, for the reward of God endureth for euer. Before thou prayest prepare thy soule, and be not as one that tempteth God. VVe must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider therefore when we pray in whose presence wee stand, to
<pb facs="tcp:7007:18"/> whom we speake, and what we desire. VVe stand in the presence of the Almightie Creator of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth and al things ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in contayned. To whose eternal maiestie innumerable thousands of Angelles do assist, serue, and obey. VVe speake vnto him who knoweth the secrets of all hearts, before whom nothing is more odious then hipocrisie and dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation. VVe ought to aske those thinges which be most to his glory and the comfort of our conscience: VVe must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diligently with all reuerent and godly feare endeuour our selues to remoue all such thinges
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7007:18"/> as we offend his diuine maiestie in, to the vttermost of our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And first, that we be free frō all worldly cares and fleshly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, whereby our mindes are caried hither and thether, and being drawne out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and from the pure behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of God are pressed downe to the earth. VVe must haue our hart not onely bent vnto prayer, but as much as is possible lift vp aboue it selfe, euen to the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that is worthy for God, wee must haue a regarde that our mouth, spirite, and heart bee ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated together mindfully in fayth. For God is a spirite, and
<pb facs="tcp:7007:19"/> wilbe worshipped in spirite and truth, that is to saye, in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affections of the hart, and with a true, faithfull, and vnfayned worshipping. And therfore as at all other times hee requireth the heart, so especially in the time of prayer, when we shew our selues in his presence, and enter into cōmunication with him. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon when hee promiseth to heare all those that call vppon him, he maketh a restraint, not to heare those which do not call vppon him in truth. Seeing ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the chiefest dutie of prayer consisteth in the heart, we must wey our whole hart, and poure
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7007:19"/> out our prayers vnto God the searcher of hearts, with a sincere, vnfayned, and ardent affection before him, or els wee shall not find him. But if wee call vppon him with a sincere fayth, wee shalbe sure that he will heare our petitions. To whom be all honour, glory and prayse for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and euer.</p>

            <p>THere is no man but hee knoweth that praer is the chiefest thing that we maye present God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, for it is the head fountaine, and spring of all goodnes, and a meane to attaine eternall life. For if any man be inflamed with the loue of virginitie, or studieth to embrace the honorable estate of chast wedlock, if any man labour to bridle anger, and to acquaint himselfe with sobrietie and lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mind, if any man desire to bee pure from the infecti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and poysoned matter of enuie: briefly if any man bee mindfull of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7007:20"/> vertue what so euer it bee which helpeth to godly liuing, the same man (praier being his guide &amp; preparing the way of his life) shall right easely and prosperously obtaine his godly intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For it is impossible, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, I say, but such as aske of God puritie, righteousnes, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, goodnes, and other vertues, must needes receiue their desire &amp; petitions. Aske saith the Lorde, and it shalbe giuen you: Seeke &amp; ye kall find, knocke and it shalbe opened vnto you. For whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer asketh receiueth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shalbe opened. And againe he saith, is there any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you which if his Sonne
<pb facs="tcp:7007:21"/> aske him bread would offer him a stone? Or if he should aske him fish would offer him a Serpent? If ye thē which are euil can giue your children good giftes, howe much more shall your Father which is in heauen giue his holy spirite to them that aske it? with such sweete words, and with such hope hath the Lorde of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures prouoked vs to pray. And it becōmeth vs, yea we are bound to be obedient to God, &amp; to spend our whole life in the prayses of him, that is in prayer, more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly setting our care howe to serue God, then how to continue the state of this our life. This do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, doubtlesse we shall liue that life whiche onely beseemeth a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7007:21"/> Christian man to liue. As the wise kyng Salomon sayth: much prayer and the true seruice of god is a signe of all righteousnes, for it is the spirituall ornament, yea the godly ornament that bringeth great beautits and comlines to our mindes especially when one by it directeth his life, neither suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth any vncomely thing to rule in his soule. For prayer teacheth to stand in reuerent feare &amp; awe of God, and to giue the honour we owe vnto him: praier teacheth to cast of al the deceitfull illusions of the euill spirite, and driueth a way all idle, filthy and vncomely thoughts, it stablisheth the mind in such perfection, that it contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all voluptuous and carnall
<pb facs="tcp:7007:22"/> pleasures, with a godly minde to disdaine to be seruaunt vnto vice, and to preserue and keepe the soul and mind in Christes freedome, in pure liuing and conuersation of manners, it is comely to all suche as professe Christ. I suppose ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it is manifest to all men, that plainely it is impossible without the helpe of prayer, a man to liue vertuously in this life, &amp; in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to dispend his time, for howe can one liue godly, except diligent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly and often hee approch humbly, and vppon his knees begge grace of him that giueth all goodnes vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to man. Againe how may it bee that any man can desire to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, modest, temperate, and righteous, if he couet not greedely
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7007:22"/> the conuersation and company of him, which is the giuer not onely of these, but also of greater things then these be vnto vs. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more I will briefly declare, that although we be full of sinne whē we come to pray, yet doth faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prayer right shortly purge vs from it. What greater thing or more godly therfore can we haue then praier, which is a soueraigne medicine, and a moste present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie too euery accrased soule? And for to approue this, the exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of the Niniuites dooth come first to remembraunce, in whome it is euident, by the helpe of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they receiued forgiuenes of those manifolde wicked deedes, wherwith they had prouoked the
<pb facs="tcp:7007:23"/> vengeance of God vppon them: For as soone as they set their harts to prayer, it by &amp; by brought righteousnes vnto them, &amp; forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it amended the Citie, which of long time had bene accustomed to Lecherous liuing, to excesse, to malice, briefly to such a kind of life as was both lawles &amp; wretched, therfore prayer was a good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatiue, for it speedely entreated the anger of God imminent vpon them, and forthwith amended their corrupt and detestable lyfe. Such is the strength, such is the power of prayer, that where the Niniuits had wickedly &amp; filthely passed al the dayes of their life, yet so sone as prayer was entred into the Citie, incontinently it turned
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7007:23"/> all things vpsidowne, &amp; brought in temperance, Iustice, loue, vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, chati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie, &amp; all other goodnes: as when a Queene or Empres doth enter into a Citie, necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all wealth &amp; aboundance doth followe hir. Euen so truly after prayer doth come to the foule of man, all vertues do enter with it iointly. For as the foundation is in a house, the same is prayer in the soule. And when wee haue first fastned it as a roote, ground or stay in the soule, then must wee diligently build vpon it cleanesse, meekenes, iustice, charitie, briefly all the lawes of Christ. To whō with the father, &amp; the holy ghost, be glory and dominion for euer.</p>
